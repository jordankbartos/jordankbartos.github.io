                        <p>
                            The Virginia opossum is North America's only marsupial. The name opossum comes from the Alongquin name for the 
                            animal, "apasum" which means "white animal". Opossums are "living fossils"; they have been around for at least 
                            70 million years. That means they would have co-existed with the dinosaurs! Opossums are known to predate on 
                            venemous snakes, and they are highly resistant to snake venom. They are also highly resistent to rabies because their
                            normal body temperatue is uncommonly low - well below the temperature at which the rabies virus's chemistry is 
                            designed for. It is exceptionally rare for an opossum to have rabies. Although, they can carry other dangerous
                            diseases such as tuberculosis and leptispirosis.

                    <h2>Physical Properties and Appearance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Opossums have triangular heads and long pointed noses. They are covered in fur everywhere except on their ears, 
                        feet, and tails which are bare. Their fur can be white, brown, and/or gray, and thier hairless ears, nose, and tails 
                        are pink. In northern climates, they often lose their tails due to frostbite. Opossums have opposable 
                        thumb-like fingers that they used to help climb trees and carry things. With 50 teeth, opossums have more teeth than 
                        any other North American land mammal.

                        <h3>General</h3>
                        <p>
                            Opossums are nocturnal, meaning they are active at night and sleep during the day. They like to 
                            find a small space to sleep such as a hole in a tree.

                        <h3>"Playing Opossum"</h3>
                        <p>
                            Opossums are most famous for their habit of playing dead when threatened. The world can be a frightening 
                            place for opossums - they are frequently threatened by dogs, cats, foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and humans. 
                            When confronted, opossums will usually pass out, foam at the mouth, and emit a foul smell. This 
                            is an involuntary reaction, although the opossum is believed to remain fully 
                            conscious while in this state. This can last for up to six hours.

                        <h3>Climbing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Opossums are excellent climbers. They have, thumbs, sharp claws, and prehensile tails for gripping tree 
                            branches. They spend much of their time up in trees.

                        <h3>Habitat and Range</h3>
                        <p>
                            Opossums can be found in deciduous forests, open woods, and farms. But they prefer wet areas such as marshes, 
                            swamps, and streams. They can be found in most of the southern, eastern, and midwestern United States as well
                            as along the west coast and throughout Mexico.

                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                    <p>
                        Opossums are opportunistic omnivores. They graze on grass, nuts, and fruit. They will hunt for mice, 
                        birds, ticks, slugs, snails, worms, snakes, and more. An opossum can eat thousands of ticks per week 
                        which makes them extremely important in keeping the prevalence of Lyme Disease down. They also scavenge on 
                        dead animals which further helps prevent the spread of disease.

                    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        The gestation period for an opossum is a very brief 11-13 days. After which, the baby opossums move 
                        to the pouch where they continue to develop for the next eight weeks. After that, baby opossums move out 
                        of the pouch and ride around on their mother's back for another four to six weeks. Opossums may give birth 
                        to 20 babies, but typicaly only up to half of them survive to become independent. Opossums can have up 
                        to three litters per year.
